# ![App icon](https://github.com/MikeCheek/ExpensesApp/blob/main/android/app/src/main/res/mipmap-mdpi/ic_launcher.png) Expense Tracker App

A simple Expenses Tracker App created following [this tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xn2V8tvN4cM) but with some improvements:
-  Used Typescript
-  Added app icon (created with https://icon.kitchen)
-  Saved in AsyncStorage the logged firebase user (to not log in every time)
-  Delete trip/expense gesture by swiping and click
-  Added a chart for each trip showing the percentage of expenses based on their topic
